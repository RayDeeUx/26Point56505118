Rotate objects by 26.56505118 degrees!

To find the buttons, open the "Free Rotate" menu while objects are selected.

## <cy>***__For best results__******: You are responsible for enabling the "Full Precision Object Rotation" setting in the [High Precision Editor mod by kxtbit](mod:kxtbit.high_precision_editor).***</c>

Reuses some code from HJfod's BetterEdit mod for compatibility with the vanilla free rotation slider and the vanilla editor's undo/redo system.

Rotate objects by 26.56505118 degrees!

To find the buttons, open the "Free Rotate" menu while objects are selected.

Higher precision included if "Full Precision Object Rotation" in the [High Precision Editor mod by kxtbit](mod:kxtbit.high_precision_editor) is enabled.

Reuses some code from HJfod's BetterEdit mod for compatibility with the vanilla free rotation slider.
